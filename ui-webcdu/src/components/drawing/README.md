# Drawing Canvas Integration

This directory contains the implementation of Task 3: "Create DrawingCanvas component with basic pen tool".

## Components

### DrawingCanvas
The main canvas component that handles drawing operations:
- HTML5 canvas with proper sizing and positioning
- Mouse event handlers for drawing operations
- Pen tool with configurable brush size and color
- Canvas overlay positioning relative to React Flow

### DrawingCanvasOverlay
Integration component that syncs the DrawingCanvas with React Flow:
- Automatically matches React Flow viewport size
- Syncs zoom and pan transformations
- Proper z-index layering (above background, below nodes)

### DrawingDemo
A demonstration component showing how to integrate drawing tools with React Flow.

## Usage

```tsx
import { DrawingProvider } from '../contexts/DrawingContext';
import { DrawingCanvasOverlay } from './DrawingCanvasOverlay';

function App() {
  return (
    <ReactFlowProvider>
      <DrawingProvider>
        <div className="relative w-full h-full">
          <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges}>
            <Background />
            <Controls />
          </ReactFlow>
          
          {/* Add drawing overlay */}
          <DrawingCanvasOverlay />
        </div>
      </DrawingProvider>
    </ReactFlowProvider>
  );
}
```

## Features Implemented

✅ HTML5 canvas component with proper sizing and positioning
✅ Mouse event handlers for drawing operations  
✅ Pen tool with configurable brush size and color
✅ Canvas overlay positioning relative to React Flow
✅ Integration with existing DrawingEngine and DrawingContext
✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Requirements Satisfied

- **1.1**: Drawing tool enables freehand drawing mode ✅
- **1.2**: Continuous line drawing following mouse movement ✅  
- **1.5**: Brush size configuration applied to strokes ✅
- **1.6**: Brush color configuration applied to strokes ✅

## Technical Details

- Uses HTML5 Canvas API for drawing operations
- Integrates with React Flow viewport transformations
- Handles high DPI displays with proper canvas scaling
- Prevents context menu on right-click
- Manages drawing state through React Context
- Supports viewport synchronization (zoom/pan)

## Testing

All components have comprehensive test coverage:
- DrawingCanvas: 9 tests covering rendering, events, and configuration
- DrawingCanvasOverlay: 4 tests covering integration and positioning
- Full integration with existing DrawingEngine and DrawingContext tests
