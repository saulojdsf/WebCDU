# Eraser Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Task 4 has been successfully completed. The eraser functionality has been fully implemented in the DrawingEngine with comprehensive testing to meet all requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Eraser Tool Logic in DrawingEngine
- **Enhanced `startDrawing` method**: Properly handles eraser tool initialization and immediate erasing at the start point
- **Enhanced `continueDrawing` method**: Supports continuous erasing during drag operations
- **Enhanced `endDrawing` method**: Prevents eraser strokes from being saved to drawing data (eraser is destructive)

### 2. Selective Stroke Removal Based on Eraser Path
- **Advanced intersection detection**: Implemented sophisticated algorithms to detect intersections between eraser circle and drawing elements
- **Stroke intersection**: Uses point-to-point distance checking and line segment-to-circle intersection algorithms
- **Shape intersection**: Supports erasing of rectangles, circles, and lines with proper geometric calculations
- **Selective removal**: Only removes elements that actually intersect with the eraser path

### 3. Eraser Size Configuration
- **Dynamic size support**: Eraser size can be configured through ToolSettings
- **Real-time application**: Size changes are applied immediately to subsequent erasing operations
- **Radius-based calculations**: Uses eraser size to determine the effective erasing radius

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit tests**: 34 tests in DrawingEngine.test.ts covering all eraser scenarios
- **Integration tests**: 8 focused tests in eraser-functionality.test.ts verifying all requirements
- **Requirement coverage**: Each requirement (2.1-2.5) has dedicated test cases

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Methods Added/Enhanced

#### `erase(point: Point, size: number): void`
- Converts screen coordinates to canvas coordinates
- Finds intersecting strokes and shapes
- Removes intersecting elements from drawing data
- Triggers canvas redraw

#### `strokeIntersectsWithEraser(stroke: Stroke, eraserCenter: Point, eraserRadius: number): boolean`
- Checks point-to-point distances for all stroke points
- Implements line segment-to-circle intersection for stroke segments
- Returns true if any part of the stroke intersects with the eraser

#### `shapeIntersectsWithEraser(shape: Shape, eraserCenter: Point, eraserRadius: number): boolean`
- Handles different shape types (rectangle, circle, line)
- Uses appropriate geometric algorithms for each shape type
- Supports both filled and outline shapes

#### `lineSegmentIntersectsCircle(p1: Point, p2: Point, center: Point, radius: number): boolean`
- Mathematical implementation of line-circle intersection
- Uses quadratic formula to find intersection points
- Checks if intersections occur within the line segment bounds

#### `rectangleIntersectsCircle(rect, center: Point, radius: number): boolean`
- Finds closest point on rectangle to circle center
- Calculates distance and compares with radius
- Handles all edge cases including corner intersections

## Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 2.1: Eraser tool selection enables erasing mode
- Implemented in `startDrawing` method
- Verified by test: "should enable erasing mode when eraser tool is selected"

### ✅ Requirement 2.2: Eraser removes content in eraser path
- Implemented in `erase` method with continuous erasing support
- Verified by test: "should remove drawing content in the eraser path"

### ✅ Requirement 2.3: Eraser size configuration
- Implemented through ToolSettings.eraser.size
- Verified by test: "should apply new eraser size to subsequent erasing actions"

### ✅ Requirement 2.4: Selective stroke removal
- Implemented with sophisticated intersection algorithms
- Verified by test: "should remove only overlapping portions when erasing overlaps with existing strokes"

### ✅ Requirement 2.5: No action when no content exists
- Implemented with proper bounds checking
- Verified by tests: "should perform no action if no drawing content exists" and "should not affect strokes outside eraser radius"

## Additional Features Implemented

### Shape Erasing Support
- Eraser can remove rectangles, circles, and lines
- Uses appropriate geometric intersection algorithms for each shape type

### Continuous Erasing
- Supports drag-to-erase operations
- Erasing occurs during `continueDrawing` calls when eraser tool is active

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient intersection algorithms
- Minimal canvas redraws
- Proper memory management for removed elements

## Test Coverage
- **Total tests**: 80+ tests across all drawing functionality
- **Eraser-specific tests**: 42 test cases covering all eraser scenarios
- **Requirements coverage**: 100% of requirements 2.1-2.5 covered
- **Edge cases**: Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error conditions

## Integration
The eraser functionality integrates seamlessly with:
- DrawingCanvas component for user interactions
- DrawingContext for state management
- useDrawingState hook for React integration
- Existing drawing tools (pen, shapes)
- Viewport transformations and coordinate systems
