# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The improved node grouping feature enhances the existing grouping system in the Control Loop Designer Webapp to provide a more intuitive and robust user experience. The current implementation has several usability issues: the context menu appears only when clicking outside the selection zone, nodes can be moved out of their groups, groups cannot be properly selected for movement or ungrouping, and arrangement methods don't respect group boundaries. This feature will address these issues to create a more cohesive and predictable grouping system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an engineer using the diagram editor, I want the group context menu to appear when I right-click on selected nodes, so that I can easily access grouping options without having to click outside the selection zone.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN multiple nodes are selected AND I right-click on any of the selected nodes THEN the system SHALL display the context menu with the "Group" option
2. WHEN I right-click on a group background THEN the system SHALL display the context menu with the "Ungroup" option
3. WHEN the context menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it at the cursor location
4. WHEN I click outside the context menu THEN the system SHALL close the menu without performing any action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an engineer working with grouped nodes, I want nodes to remain within their group boundaries, so that the visual organization is maintained during editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I attempt to drag a node that belongs to a group THEN the system SHALL constrain its movement to within the group boundaries
2. WHEN a node reaches the edge of its group during dragging THEN the system SHALL prevent further movement in that direction
3. WHEN I attempt to drag a node outside its group THEN the system SHALL either expand the group bounds or stop the node at the group boundary
4. WHEN a node is moved within its group THEN the system SHALL update the group bounds if necessary to maintain proper padding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an engineer organizing my diagram, I want to be able to select entire groups for manipulation, so that I can efficiently reorganize my diagram layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I click on a group's background or border THEN the system SHALL select the entire group
2. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL visually highlight the group border to indicate selection
3. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL enable dragging of the entire group as a unit
4. WHEN I press Delete while a group is selected THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deleting the group and its contents
5. WHEN I right-click on a selected group THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with group-specific options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an engineer using automatic arrangement features, I want arrangement methods to respect group boundaries, so that my organizational structure is preserved during layout optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I apply an arrangement method THEN the system SHALL treat groups as cohesive units
2. WHEN nodes within a group are arranged THEN the system SHALL only arrange them relative to each other within the group boundaries
3. WHEN the entire diagram is arranged THEN the system SHALL position groups as units while maintaining their internal structure
4. WHEN a group is moved during arrangement THEN the system SHALL maintain the relative positions of all nodes within the group
5. WHEN arrangement is complete THEN the system SHALL update all group bounds to properly contain their member nodes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an engineer working with complex diagrams, I want improved visual feedback for group interactions, so that I can clearly understand the current state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I hover over a group border THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator that the group can be selected
2. WHEN I start dragging a group THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that the entire group is being moved
3. WHEN I attempt an invalid action with a group THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual or tooltip feedback about why the action is not allowed
4. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL display handles or indicators for group-level operations
5. WHEN multiple groups are selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual differentiation between primary and secondary selection
