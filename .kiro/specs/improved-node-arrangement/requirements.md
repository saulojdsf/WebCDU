# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the node rearrangement functionality in the Control Loop Designer webapp. Currently, the application has basic auto-arrangement capabilities using simple layer-based positioning and ELK.js Sugiyama layout. The improved system should provide more intelligent, flexible, and user-friendly node arrangement options that better handle complex control diagrams while maintaining visual clarity and logical flow representation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a control engineer, I want intelligent automatic node arrangement that considers signal flow direction and minimizes edge crossings, so that my control diagrams are visually clear and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers auto-arrangement THEN the system SHALL analyze the signal flow from input nodes to output nodes
2. WHEN arranging nodes THEN the system SHALL minimize edge crossings between connections
3. WHEN multiple arrangement algorithms are available THEN the system SHALL provide options for different layout strategies
4. WHEN nodes have no connections THEN the system SHALL group them separately to avoid cluttering the main flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user working with large diagrams, I want smart spacing and alignment of nodes, so that the diagram remains readable and professionally formatted regardless of complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN arranging nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing between nodes in the same layer
2. WHEN nodes have different sizes THEN the system SHALL align them properly to maintain visual balance
3. WHEN the diagram has multiple parallel paths THEN the system SHALL distribute them evenly to avoid overcrowding
4. WHEN arranging nodes THEN the system SHALL respect minimum and maximum spacing constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preserve manual positioning preferences while still benefiting from automatic arrangement, so that I can maintain control over critical node placements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nodes are manually positioned by the user THEN the system SHALL provide an option to lock their positions during auto-arrangement
2. WHEN some nodes are locked THEN the system SHALL arrange unlocked nodes around the locked ones optimally
3. WHEN the user selects specific nodes THEN the system SHALL provide an option to arrange only the selected nodes
4. WHEN arrangement is applied THEN the system SHALL provide undo functionality to revert changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time preview of arrangement changes, so that I can see the result before committing to the new layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over arrangement options THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the proposed layout
2. WHEN previewing arrangements THEN the system SHALL highlight which nodes will be moved
3. WHEN the user is satisfied with the preview THEN the system SHALL apply the arrangement on confirmation
4. WHEN the user cancels the preview THEN the system SHALL restore the original positions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with different types of control diagrams, I want arrangement presets optimized for common control system patterns, so that I can quickly format my diagrams according to industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects arrangement presets THEN the system SHALL offer options like "Hierarchical", "Circular", "Grid", and "Force-Directed"
2. WHEN using hierarchical arrangement THEN the system SHALL organize nodes in clear input-to-output layers
3. WHEN using circular arrangement THEN the system SHALL position nodes in a circular pattern suitable for feedback loops
4. WHEN using grid arrangement THEN the system SHALL align nodes to a regular grid pattern
5. WHEN using force-directed arrangement THEN the system SHALL use physics simulation to find optimal positions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the arrangement system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably even with complex or unusual diagram structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diagram contains cycles or feedback loops THEN the system SHALL detect and handle them appropriately
2. WHEN nodes have multiple inputs or outputs THEN the system SHALL position them to minimize connection complexity
3. WHEN the diagram has disconnected components THEN the system SHALL arrange each component separately
4. WHEN arrangement fails or produces poor results THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and error messages
