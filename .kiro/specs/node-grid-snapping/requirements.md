# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds grid snapping functionality to the node editor, allowing users to toggle between free-form node positioning and grid-aligned positioning. When enabled, nodes will automatically snap to predefined grid positions, making it easier to create organized and aligned node layouts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle grid snapping on and off, so that I can choose between precise grid alignment and free-form positioning based on my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the grid snap toggle button THEN the system SHALL enable or disable grid snapping mode
2. WHEN grid snapping is enabled THEN the system SHALL display a visual grid overlay on the canvas
3. WHEN grid snapping is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide the visual grid overlay
4. WHEN the grid snap toggle is activated THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the current state (enabled/disabled)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want nodes to automatically snap to grid positions when grid snapping is enabled, so that I can easily create aligned and organized node layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grid snapping is enabled AND a user drags a node THEN the system SHALL snap the node to the nearest grid intersection
2. WHEN grid snapping is enabled AND a user creates a new node THEN the system SHALL place the node at the nearest grid position
3. WHEN a node is snapped to the grid THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the snap occurred
4. WHEN grid snapping is disabled THEN nodes SHALL move freely without any grid constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want existing nodes to optionally snap to the grid when I enable grid snapping, so that I can organize my current layout without having to manually reposition each node.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grid snapping is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide an option to snap all existing nodes to the grid
2. WHEN the user chooses to snap existing nodes THEN the system SHALL move all nodes to their nearest grid positions
3. WHEN snapping existing nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain relative positioning as much as possible
4. IF snapping would cause nodes to overlap THEN the system SHALL find the nearest available grid positions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the grid to be visually clear but not distracting, so that I can focus on my node work while still benefiting from the alignment guides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grid is displayed THEN the system SHALL use subtle visual styling that doesn't interfere with node visibility
2. WHEN nodes are placed on the grid THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate contrast between grid lines and node elements
3. WHEN the grid is active THEN the system SHALL use a configurable grid size that works well with typical node dimensions
4. WHEN zooming in or out THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate grid visibility and density
