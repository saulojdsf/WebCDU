# Design Document - Node Grid Snapping

## Overview

The node grid snapping feature provides users with the ability to toggle between free-form node positioning and grid-aligned positioning in the node editor. This feature enhances workflow efficiency by allowing precise alignment when needed while maintaining flexibility for creative layouts.

The system consists of three main components: a toggle control for enabling/disabling grid snapping, a visual grid overlay system, and automatic node positioning logic that snaps nodes to grid intersections.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GridSnapController**: Central coordinator that manages grid snapping state and coordinates between UI components
2. **GridOverlay**: Renders the visual grid on the canvas with appropriate styling and zoom responsiveness
3. **NodePositionManager**: Handles node positioning logic, including snap-to-grid calculations and collision detection
4. **GridSnapToggle**: UI component for toggling grid snapping on/off with visual state feedback

### Component Interaction Flow

```
User Toggle → GridSnapController → GridOverlay (show/hide)
                                 → NodePositionManager (enable/disable snapping)
                                 → GridSnapToggle (update visual state)

Node Drag → NodePositionManager → Calculate nearest grid position
                                → Apply position with visual feedback
```

## Components and Interfaces

### GridSnapController

**Purpose**: Manages the overall grid snapping state and coordinates component interactions.

**Key Methods**:
- `toggleGridSnap()`: Enables/disables grid snapping mode
- `isGridSnapEnabled()`: Returns current grid snapping state
- `snapExistingNodes()`: Snaps all existing nodes to grid positions
- `getGridSize()`: Returns current grid size configuration

**State Management**:
- Maintains grid snapping enabled/disabled state
- Stores grid size and visual properties
- Tracks which nodes have been snapped

### GridOverlay

**Purpose**: Renders the visual grid overlay on the canvas.

**Key Features**:
- Subtle visual styling to avoid interference with nodes
- Responsive to zoom levels - adjusts grid density and visibility
- Configurable grid size (default: 20px intervals)
- CSS-based rendering for performance

**Visual Design Rationale**: Uses light gray lines (opacity: 0.3) to provide guidance without overwhelming the interface. Grid lines become more transparent at high zoom levels to prevent visual clutter.

### NodePositionManager

**Purpose**: Handles all node positioning logic including snap calculations.

**Key Methods**:
- `snapToGrid(position)`: Calculates nearest grid intersection
- `findAvailableGridPosition(position, excludeNodes)`: Finds nearest available position to avoid overlaps
- `moveNodeToGrid(nodeId)`: Moves specific node to nearest grid position
- `validateGridPosition(position)`: Ensures position is valid and available

**Snap Algorithm**: Uses simple rounding to nearest grid intersection: `Math.round(position / gridSize) * gridSize`

**Collision Handling**: When multiple nodes would snap to the same position, uses spiral search pattern to find nearest available grid positions.

### GridSnapToggle

**Purpose**: Provides user interface for toggling grid snapping.

**Visual States**:
- Enabled: Highlighted button with grid icon
- Disabled: Normal button state with grid icon
- Includes tooltip indicating current state

## Data Models

### GridConfiguration

```typescript
interface GridConfiguration {
  size: number;           // Grid cell size in pixels
  enabled: boolean;       // Current snap state
  showOverlay: boolean;   // Whether to show visual grid
  snapThreshold: number;  // Distance threshold for snapping
}
```

### NodePosition

```typescript
interface NodePosition {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  isSnapped: boolean;     // Whether position is grid-aligned
  gridX?: number;         // Grid coordinate X
  gridY?: number;         // Grid coordinate Y
}
```

## Error Handling

### Grid Calculation Errors
- **Issue**: Invalid grid positions or calculations
- **Handling**: Fallback to free-form positioning with user notification

### Node Overlap Resolution
- **Issue**: Multiple nodes snapping to same grid position
- **Handling**: Automatic redistribution to nearest available positions using spiral search algorithm

### Performance Considerations
- **Issue**: Grid rendering performance at high zoom levels
- **Handling**: Dynamic grid density adjustment and rendering optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Grid position calculation accuracy
- Collision detection and resolution algorithms
- State management in GridSnapController
- Visual feedback mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end toggle functionality
- Node dragging with grid snapping enabled/disabled
- Existing node snapping feature
- Grid overlay visibility at different zoom levels

### User Experience Tests
- Grid visibility and contrast validation
- Performance testing with large numbers of nodes
- Accessibility testing for toggle controls
- Cross-browser compatibility for grid rendering

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Toggle**: Verify grid snapping can be enabled/disabled
2. **Node Dragging**: Test node snapping during drag operations
3. **New Node Creation**: Verify new nodes snap to grid when enabled
4. **Existing Node Snapping**: Test bulk snapping of existing nodes
5. **Collision Resolution**: Test behavior when nodes would overlap
6. **Zoom Responsiveness**: Verify grid adapts to different zoom levels
7. **Visual Feedback**: Confirm appropriate visual indicators for all states

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimizations
- Grid overlay uses CSS transforms for efficient rendering
- Node position calculations are debounced during drag operations
- Grid visibility automatically adjusts based on zoom level to prevent performance issues

### Accessibility Considerations
- Toggle button includes proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Grid snapping state is announced to screen readers
- High contrast mode compatibility for grid overlay

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses standard CSS Grid and Transform properties
- Fallback rendering for older browsers
- Touch device support for mobile interfaces
