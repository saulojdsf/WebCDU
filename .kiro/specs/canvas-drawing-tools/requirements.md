# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive drawing capabilities to the canvas application, enabling users to create freehand drawings, erase content, and add geometric forms. The drawing tools will provide an intuitive interface for creative expression and annotation within the existing canvas environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to draw freehand on the canvas, so that I can create custom sketches and annotations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the drawing tool THEN the system SHALL enable freehand drawing mode
2. WHEN the user clicks and drags on the canvas THEN the system SHALL draw a continuous line following the mouse movement
3. WHEN the user releases the mouse button THEN the system SHALL complete the current stroke
4. WHEN the user draws multiple strokes THEN the system SHALL preserve all previous drawings
5. IF the user adjusts brush size THEN the system SHALL apply the new size to subsequent strokes
6. IF the user changes brush color THEN the system SHALL apply the new color to subsequent strokes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to erase parts of my drawings, so that I can correct mistakes and modify my artwork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the eraser tool THEN the system SHALL enable erasing mode
2. WHEN the user clicks and drags with the eraser THEN the system SHALL remove drawing content in the eraser path
3. WHEN the user adjusts eraser size THEN the system SHALL apply the new size to subsequent erasing actions
4. WHEN erasing overlaps with existing strokes THEN the system SHALL remove only the overlapping portions
5. IF no drawing content exists in the eraser path THEN the system SHALL perform no action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add geometric forms to the canvas, so that I can create structured diagrams and shapes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a shape tool (rectangle, circle, line) THEN the system SHALL enable shape drawing mode
2. WHEN the user clicks and drags to define a shape THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the shape being created
3. WHEN the user releases the mouse button THEN the system SHALL finalize the shape on the canvas
4. WHEN creating rectangles THEN the system SHALL support both filled and outline-only options
5. WHEN creating circles THEN the system SHALL support both filled and outline-only options
6. WHEN creating lines THEN the system SHALL draw straight lines between start and end points
7. IF the user holds Shift while creating shapes THEN the system SHALL constrain proportions (perfect squares, circles)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize drawing tool properties, so that I can achieve the desired visual appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses tool settings THEN the system SHALL display options for brush size, color, and opacity
2. WHEN the user changes brush size THEN the system SHALL update the cursor to reflect the new size
3. WHEN the user selects a color THEN the system SHALL apply it to the active drawing tool
4. WHEN the user adjusts opacity THEN the system SHALL apply transparency to subsequent drawing operations
5. IF the user switches between tools THEN the system SHALL maintain individual settings for each tool

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my drawing layers, so that I can organize and control different elements of my artwork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates drawings THEN the system SHALL place them on a dedicated drawing layer
2. WHEN the user toggles layer visibility THEN the system SHALL show or hide all drawing content
3. WHEN the user clears the drawing layer THEN the system SHALL remove all drawing content while preserving other canvas elements
4. IF drawings overlap with existing canvas nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layering order
5. WHEN the user saves the canvas THEN the system SHALL include drawing data in the saved state
