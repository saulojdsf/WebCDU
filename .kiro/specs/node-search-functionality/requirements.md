# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to quickly locate and highlight specific nodes in the graph visualization by searching for either node IDs or variable names. The search functionality will provide two distinct search modes: direct node ID lookup and variable-based search that finds nodes connected by specific input/output variables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for a node by its unique ID, so that I can quickly locate and focus on a specific node in complex graphs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a node ID in the search field THEN the system SHALL locate the matching node and highlight it visually
2. WHEN a node is found by ID search THEN the system SHALL automatically center the view on the selected node
3. WHEN a node ID search returns no results THEN the system SHALL display a "Node not found" message
4. WHEN a user clears the search field THEN the system SHALL remove all highlighting and return to normal view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for nodes by variable name, so that I can identify all nodes that use a specific input or output variable and see their connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a variable name in the search field THEN the system SHALL find all nodes that have Vin or Vout matching that variable name
2. WHEN nodes are found by variable search THEN the system SHALL highlight all matching nodes and the edges connecting them
3. WHEN variable search returns multiple nodes THEN the system SHALL adjust the view to show all highlighted nodes
4. WHEN a variable search returns no results THEN the system SHALL display a "Variable not found" message
5. WHEN multiple nodes share the same variable THEN the system SHALL highlight the data flow path between them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and accessible search interface, so that I can easily switch between search modes and understand the search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the search interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide a search input field with clear placeholder text
2. WHEN a user focuses on the search field THEN the system SHALL indicate the available search modes (ID vs variable)
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing what was found
4. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL maintain search state until cleared or a new search is performed
5. IF the search field is empty THEN the system SHALL show no highlighting and display all nodes normally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want search results to be visually distinct, so that I can easily identify found nodes and their relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nodes are highlighted from search THEN the system SHALL use a distinct color or visual treatment different from normal selection
2. WHEN edges are highlighted from variable search THEN the system SHALL visually emphasize the connections between matching nodes
3. WHEN search highlighting is active THEN the system SHALL dim or de-emphasize non-matching nodes for better contrast
4. WHEN a user hovers over highlighted search results THEN the system SHALL provide additional visual feedback
5. WHEN search results include multiple items THEN the system SHALL ensure all highlighted elements are clearly distinguishable
