# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to select multiple nodes in the control diagram canvas and group them together as a cohesive unit. Groups provide visual organization through a rounded rectangle background and allow collective manipulation of multiple nodes. Each group can have a descriptive title displayed on the canvas, making complex diagrams easier to understand and navigate.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an engineer creating control diagrams, I want to select multiple nodes and group them together, so that I can organize related components and move them as a single unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple nodes using Ctrl+click or drag selection THEN the system SHALL highlight all selected nodes
2. WHEN I right-click on selected nodes THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with "Group" option
3. WHEN I click "Group" THEN the system SHALL create a visual group containing all selected nodes
4. WHEN a group is created THEN the system SHALL display a rounded rectangle background with transparent fill around the grouped nodes
5. WHEN I click on space within a group THEN the system SHALL select the entire group
6. WHEN I drag a grouped node THEN the system SHALL move all nodes in the group together maintaining their relative positions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an engineer organizing complex diagrams, I want to add descriptive titles to my groups, so that I can clearly identify the purpose of each grouped section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new group THEN the system SHALL prompt me to enter a group title
2. WHEN I enter a group title THEN the system SHALL display the title at the top of the group's rounded rectangle
3. WHEN I double-click on a group title THEN the system SHALL allow me to edit the title inline
4. WHEN I press Enter or click outside the title editor THEN the system SHALL save the new title
5. IF no title is provided THEN the system SHALL display a default title like "Group 1", "Group 2", etc.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an engineer working with grouped nodes, I want to ungroup nodes when needed, so that I can reorganize my diagram structure flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a group THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with "Ungroup" option
2. WHEN I click "Ungroup" THEN the system SHALL remove the group visual container
3. WHEN a group is ungrouped THEN the system SHALL preserve all individual nodes in their current positions
4. WHEN a group is ungrouped THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing connections between nodes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an engineer using the diagram editor, I want groups to have proper visual styling, so that they enhance readability without interfering with the diagram content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a group is displayed THEN the system SHALL render a rounded rectangle with corner radius of 8px
2. WHEN a group is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a transparent background color that doesn't obscure node content
3. WHEN a group is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a subtle border color that provides clear visual separation
4. WHEN the theme changes between light and dark mode THEN the system SHALL adjust group colors appropriately
5. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the group border with a selection color

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an engineer saving and loading diagrams, I want group information to persist, so that my organizational structure is maintained across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save a diagram with groups THEN the system SHALL include group data in the saved file
2. WHEN I load a diagram with groups THEN the system SHALL restore all group visual containers and titles
3. WHEN I export to CDU format THEN the system SHALL preserve the logical connections while ignoring group visual elements
4. WHEN groups are saved THEN the system SHALL store group ID, title, member node IDs, and visual properties

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an engineer working with complex diagrams, I want to select and manipulate entire groups efficiently, so that I can quickly reorganize large sections of my diagram.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a group background THEN the system SHALL select the entire group
2. WHEN I drag a selected group THEN the system SHALL move all member nodes together
3. WHEN I delete a selected group THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before removing all member nodes
4. WHEN I copy a selected group THEN the system SHALL copy all member nodes and their internal connections
5. WHEN I paste a copied group THEN the system SHALL create new instances of all nodes with preserved relative positioning
