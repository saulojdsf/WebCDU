# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide users with the ability to toggle between light and dark visual themes in the application. The dark mode toggle will offer an alternative visual experience that reduces eye strain in low-light environments and provides users with their preferred visual aesthetic. The toggle should be easily accessible, persistent across sessions, and provide a smooth transition between themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark visual themes, so that I can choose the visual appearance that best suits my preferences and environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the dark mode toggle THEN the system SHALL switch the visual theme from light to dark or dark to light
2. WHEN the dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply dark background colors, light text colors, and appropriate contrast ratios throughout the interface
3. WHEN the light mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply light background colors, dark text colors, and standard contrast ratios throughout the interface
4. WHEN the user toggles the theme THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth visual transition between themes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't have to re-select my preferred theme every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a theme preference THEN the system SHALL store this preference in local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL automatically apply their previously selected theme
3. IF no theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL default to the system's preferred color scheme
4. WHEN the system detects a change in the user's system color scheme preference THEN the system SHALL update the theme accordingly if no manual preference is set

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode toggle to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly switch themes when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the application interface THEN the system SHALL display a clearly visible theme toggle control
2. WHEN the user hovers over the toggle control THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the control is interactive
3. WHEN the toggle is in dark mode state THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate icon or indicator showing the current theme
4. WHEN the toggle is in light mode state THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate icon or indicator showing the current theme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interface elements to properly support both light and dark themes, so that the application remains fully functional and visually consistent in either mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL ensure all text remains readable with appropriate contrast ratios
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL apply theme-appropriate colors to all UI components including buttons, forms, cards, and navigation elements
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and component states (hover, active, disabled) with appropriate dark theme styling
4. WHEN switching between themes THEN the system SHALL ensure no interface elements become invisible or unusable
